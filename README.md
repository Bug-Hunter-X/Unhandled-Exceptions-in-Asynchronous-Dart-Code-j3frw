# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Dart:  incompletely handled exceptions in asynchronous operations.  The original code lacks robust error handling, potentially leading to application crashes or unpredictable behavior.

The `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with more comprehensive error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `bug.dart`. Observe the output. Note the lack of specific error details if the API request fails or the JSON decoding is incorrect.
3.  Run `bugSolution.dart`. Observe the improved error handling and more informative output.
